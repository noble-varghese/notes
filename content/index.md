# Hello, World! I'm Noble Varghese üëã

I'm a backend software engineer with a passion for infrastructure and a knack for turning coffee into code. For the past 5 years, I've been navigating the exciting waters of startup engineering, always eager to dive deep into the backend realm.

Growing up in a middle-class family, my curiosity about computers wasn't just a passing phase‚Äîit became my career and calling. Now, I'm on a mission to build robust systems and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## What Drives Me

- **Backend Engineering**: There's something magical about creating the invisible engines that power the web.
- **Infrastructure**: I love architecting systems that can scale and stand the test of time (and traffic!).
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that shape the future of tech? Count me in!

## Projects & Contributions

I believe in the power of community-driven development. Here are some open-source projects I've had the privilege to contribute to:

- [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)
- [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)
- [Portkey](https://github.com/portkey-api/portkey)
- [GoogleGo](https://github.com/golang/go)
- [Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector)

## Professional Journey

My career has been a thrilling ride through the startup ecosystem:
Each role has been a stepping stone, allowing me to hone my skills in Python, Node.js/TypeScript, and Go. I've learned that in the world of startups, adaptability is just as crucial as technical prowess.

## Tech Musings

When I'm not coding, I'm often writing about it. My blog covers a range of topics in the tech world. Here are some recent posts:

- [The Art of Scalable Backend Design](/blog/scalable-backend-design)
- [Navigating the Open Source Galaxy](/blog/open-source-contributions)
- [Python vs. Go: A Backend Developer's Perspective](/blog/python-vs-go)

## Beyond the Screen

Life isn't all about code (shocking, I know!). When I step away from the keyboard:

- üèûÔ∏è I'm exploring new terrains on foot, camera in hand
- üì∏ Capturing moments and memories through photography
- üåü Dreaming up the next big tech idea

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, potential collaborators, or anyone who wants to chat about the latest in backend engineering.
